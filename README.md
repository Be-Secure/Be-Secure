## Be-Secure

Be Secure is an umbrella of open source security project.

#### Why Be-Secure

Today open source is the way forward to develop new capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects. Organizations have realized the benefits from open source software. This realization has led them to increase their adoption of open source projects to build business capabilities. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. They are open for customizations to address specific needs.

#### Who is Be-Secure for –

Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by their tools to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.

Developers, auditors, and regulators can create and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.

Developers and researchers can identify security issues (including unintentional vulnerabilities and malicious software) and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.

Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.

#### TAVOSS 

TAVOSS is Trusted And Verified Open Source software that has undergone a security assessment by the Be-Secure Community.

#### Security Testing Environments

Open source is vast and it is impossible for anyone organization to keep track of all the changes . Hence we have identified few BeSecure Open source tech stacks or blue prints that we call as environments to help the BeSecure community  to do focused security assessment of key open source projects and technology used frequently to build enterprise grade open source solution. Each BeSecure tech stack will be associated with two types of BeSman environment namely the provisioning or development environment [Dev] as well as the security testing or security sandbox environment [Sec].

#### BeSecure Open Source Tech stacks are –

    *   DevOps[DO] :  [Dev]()  | [Sec]()
    
    *   Language and framework [L&F] : [Dev]()  | [Sec]()
    
    *   Application [A] :   [Dev]()  | [Sec]() 
    
    *   Distributed & Decentralized Application [DA] : [Dev]()  | [Sec]()
    
    *   Open-source Security Tool [S] :  [Dev]()  | [Sec]()
  

#### OSS Project We Track :

#### OSS Project We Contribute :

[**BeSman**](https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman) is a command-line utility to provision customized environments for each TAVOSS tech stack. These environments are known 
as BeSman environments. 

[**OAH-Bes-vm**]() for easy local deployment of Besman environmens.

[**BeS-Lighthouse**]() BeS-lighthouse is a community dashboard for TAVOSS Components.
