<h2 align="center">Be-Secure</h2>

Its an umbrella of open-source security projects and utilities driven as a community initiative by Wipro. The Be-Secure projects are focused on enabling open-source communities to enhance security for their open-source projects and help build a security community around open-source. These security projects and utilities will be tracked by Wipro and its network of trusted security partners.  There is a growing trend of open-source adoption today and this growth is driving creation of lot more open-source components. It is essential to have a mechanism and community to focus on security of these open-source software components.


There are lot many open-source tech stacks out there in the world. As a start, the focus is currently set on the most popular open-source tech stacks. These tech stacks have been grouped into 5 different open-source security tech stack categories. This approach will help to focus and drive security projects/ utilities more efficiently by addressing the specific security requirements of these tech stacks.
Be-Secure projects will revolve around a set of predefined open-source security tech stacks that are curated based on their usage. 

#### The different open-source security tech stacks that has been identified based on the characteristics and type of usage are –

    *   Security of DevOps Tool stack
    
    *   Language and framework security stack
    
    *   Application security stack 
    
    *   Distributed application / blockchain security stack
    
    *   Open-source security tool security stack
  

The vision of Be-Secure community is to be one stop for all users to contribute and consume security projects to address security needs of open-source projects.

## Be-Secure Projects / Utilities:
   One of the first utilities to be created as part of Be-Secure project is BeSman.

   •	BeSman – is a command-line utility to provision customized environments for each open-source tech stack. These environments are known as BeSman environments. Please refer the following link (https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman) to know more about BeSman. It is built using bash and can be easily customized to provision new environments for an open-source tech stack based on open-source project requirements. Anyone can leverage BeSman utility to build customized environments for their projects.
