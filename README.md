Be Secure is an umbrella of open source security project.

<<<<<<< HEAD
###   Why Be-Secure:

Increased focus on open source projects now demands better focus on their security. Be-Secure projects addresses this need by focusing on addressing common security requirements of open source projects in a timely manner. Frequent tracking of changes to open source projects is essential to identify new changes and their security risk impact.

###   What is Be-Secure open source security tech stack:

Security for open source is a challenge considering the vast no of open source technologies and their frequent changes. Addressing this challenge, we have grouped various open source technologies into Be-Secure open source security tech stacks. These open source security tech stacks are identified based on their characteristics and type of usage.

###   Getting started:

You can map your projects to the Be-Secure open source security tech stack. Please refer the section [BeSecure Open Source security tech stack](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/Project_contribute/) for more details. Once you have identified the Be-Secure open source tech stack, you can then identify the BeSman environments for your project. BeSman environments comprise of dev and security testing environments for each identified open source security tech stack. These environments can be customized per project needs to help you to utilize these environments in a seamless manner to secure your projects. Once you have identified the required BeSman environments, you can access the same from the following GitHub repository [repo](https://github.com/Be-Secure/)

We have a Be-Secure Community Dashboard which can be used to identify the security stature of various open source projects we track. To access the dashboard, please visit [this section](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/Community_dashboard). This is a good option to identify the security of your project. In case if your project is not available in the dashboard, please do let us know. We plan to grow the list of open source projects we track and report their security posture using our community dashboard.

You can also contribute to our existing projects, please refer the [following section](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/Project_contribute) to more details.

Seven stages of Be-Secure CE security assessment:

We have defined a seven stage approach to assess and enhance the security posture of open source projects. Each stage is defined with a definitive objective and all together they will help strengthen the security posture of open source projects in a consistent manner. To know more about this, please visit the [following section](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/Tech_stack).

###   OSS projects we track:

We have identified a set of open source projects that we will be tracking and assessing their security posture as a community activity. This list will be a growing list where new projects gets added as we move forward. Please visit [this section](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/tracked_projects) for more details.

###   OSS projects we contribute:

We have defined and developed a command line utility known as BeSman. We are contributing this utility to the community and will continue to help enhance its capabilities as we move on. For more details visit the [section](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/Project_contribute).

###   How to contribute:

We invite all open source enthusiasts to join our community and enhance your capability as an open source security specialist. To know more about how to contribute to Be-Secure community initiative, please visit the [following section](https://be-secure.github.io/#besec_info/More_info).

#### Why Be-Secure

Open source is the way forward to develop new capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects. Organizations have realized the benefits from open source software. This realization has led them to increase their adoption of open source projects to build business capabilities. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. 

#### Who is Be-Secure for –

Organisations, open source developers, security researchers, auditors, and regulators can all benefit from Be-Secure.


#### TAVOSS 

TAVOSS is Trusted And Verified Open Source software that has undergone a security assessment by the Be-Secure Community.

#### Be-Secure Development and Security Assessment Environments

Open source is vast and we have frequent new releases ,bug fixes and patches published every day . It is impossible for any organization to keep track of all the changes that happen across the open source landscape . Hence we have identified five Be-Secure Open source tech stacks or blue prints which we call as Be-Secure environments to help the Be-Secure community navigate through security assessment of these open source projects. 

The open source projects are categorized based on  purpose,interoperability and technology ,They include other open source dependencies that are most frequently required to develop enterprise grade open source solutions.

Each Be-Secure technology stack will be associated with atleast two types of BeSman environments namely the Development or Provisioning environment [Dev] as well as the security testing or security sandbox environment [Sec].

#### Be-Secure Open Source Technology stacks are –

    * DevOps[DO] :  [Dev](Link to BeSman Dev environment List)  | [Sec](Link to BeSman Sec Environment List)
    
    * Language and framework [L&F] : [Dev](Link to BeSman Dev environment List)  | [Sec](Link to BeSman Sec Environment List)
    
    * Application [A] :   [Dev](Link to BeSman Dev environment List)  | [Sec](Link to BeSman Sec Environment List) 
    
    * Distributed & Decentralized Application [DA] : [Dev](Link to BeSman Dev environment List)  | [Sec](Link to BeSman Sec Environment List)
    
    * Open-source Security Tool [S] :  [Dev](Link to BeSman Dev environment List)  | [Sec](Link to BeSman Sec Environment List)
  
#### Benefits from Be-Secure –

Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by BeSman environments to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.

Developers, auditors, and regulators can create new BeSman Environments and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.

Security assessment environments aid Developers and researchers to identify security issues ,like unintentional vulnerabilities and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.

Be-Secure Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.
