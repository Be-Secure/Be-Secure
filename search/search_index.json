Once we receive a request from the community member / user of Be-Secure project to assess an open source tech stack, we will fork the respective open source project into Be-Secure namespace. Then we will commence with our seven stage security assessment as listed below - First stage: Identification of the blueprint for BeSman environment using the details on the open source tech stack that has been shared. Second stage: If a suitable blueprint doesn\u2019t exist, build a new BeSman environment. This will be the base environment to perform development activities for the shared open source tech stack. Third stage: Build the security testing environment/sandbox that can be utilized for conducting security testing for the specific open source tech stack. Fourth stage: Conduct security assessment and identify the vulnerabilities in it. This vulnerability information will be published. Fifth stage: Identify and develop security patches for the identified vulnerabilities. Sixth stage: Upgrade the respective BeSman environments with the confirmed new security patches to strengthen their security posture. Publish the upgraded BeSman environments for active consumption Seventh stage: For an existing BeSman environment, the focus is on identifying the latest security vulnerabilities and mapping it to the respective environment. This is a continuous activity that is focused on enhancing the security posture of BeSman environments to address the latest identified vulnerabilities.","title":"Security Assessment"},{"location":"bes-app-tech-stack.html","text":"Application [A] Tech Stack This security stack focuses on all open source applications and how they can be secured.

BeSman is a command-line utility to provision customized environments for each open source tech stack. These environments are known as BeSman environments. We have two types of BeSman environments \u2013 dev and sec environments. The development environment is pre-bundled with all tools and dependencies that a developer would need to work on a specific open source project. Similarly, the sec environments are pre-bundled with a set of open source security tools that a security tester can leverage to conduct planned security assessment. Why do we need BeSman utility Individuals spend considerable effort to set up and configure the open source project in their local environment to evaluate it / commence working on it. At times individuals run into configuration issues or set up issues which result in them spending more effort to resolve them. This is a sizeable effort that is spent just to get the environment up as compared to the effort spent to build newer capability using an existing open source project. This is a misspend effort that should be managed in a better way. The BeSman utility provides command-line capability to provision customized environments quickly and in a consistent manner. How can BeSman utility help BeSman environments are pre-bundled with tools and dependencies for a specific open project and it can be provisioned using simple bash shell commands from BeSman utility. BeSman utility will also provide configurable capabilities that would permit the user to configure the tools and dependencies to be pre-bundled in the environment. Individuals will have complete control over what goes into building and provisioning the environment. The base BeSman environment can be customized further to address specific project needs. This gives a lot of flexibility to the developer/security tester to optimize their work environment in a seamless manner.
