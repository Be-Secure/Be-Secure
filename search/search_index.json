Once we receive a request from the community member / user of Be-Secure project to assess an open source tech stack, we will fork the respective open source project into Be-Secure namespace. Then we will commence with our seven stage security assessment as listed below - First stage: Identification of the blueprint for BeSman environment using the details on the open source tech stack that has been shared. Second stage: If a suitable blueprint doesn\u2019t exist, build a new BeSman environment. This will be the base environment to perform development activities for the shared open source tech stack. Third stage: Build the security testing environment/sandbox that can be utilized for conducting security testing for the specific open source tech stack. Fourth stage: Conduct security assessment and identify the vulnerabilities in it. This vulnerability information will be published. Fifth stage: Identify and develop security patches for the identified vulnerabilities. Sixth stage: Upgrade the respective BeSman environments with the confirmed new security patches to strengthen their security posture. Publish the upgraded BeSman environments for active consumption Seventh stage: For an existing BeSman environment, the focus is on identifying the latest security vulnerabilities and mapping it to the respective environment. This is a continuous activity that is focused on enhancing the security posture of BeSman environments to address the latest identified vulnerabilities.","title":"Security Assessment"},{"location":"bes-app-tech-stack.html","text":"Application [A] Tech Stack This security stack focuses on all open source applications and how they can be secured.

Mission Establish a community of open source security specialist through Be-Secure community initiative Why Be-Secure Today open source software is an integral part of the technology landscape in many organizations. Their adoption rate is increasing year on year. The benefits from open source are multi-fold and it is the way forward to develop capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. Be-Secure is for Organizations, open source developers, security researchers, auditors and regulators \u2013 all can benefit from Be-Secure TAVOSS TAVOSS is Trusted And Verified Open Source Software that has undergone a security assessment by the Be-Secure community. Benefits from Be-Secure Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by Be-Secure security environments to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues. Developers, auditors, and regulators can create new Be-Secure security environments and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results. Security assessment environments aid developers and researchers to identify security issues, like unintentional vulnerabilities and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.
