### What is Be-Secure

It is an umbrella of [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) security projects and utilities tracked and maintained by the Be-Secure community.



### Why Be-Secure
<div align="justify">
Today open source is the way forward to develop new capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects. Organizations have realized the benefits from open source software. This realization has led them to increase their adoption of open source projects to build business capabilities. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. They are open for customizations to address specific needs.

The benefits of Be-Secure projects are –

- Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by their tools to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.

- Developers, auditors, and regulators can create and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.

- Developers and researchers can identify security issues (including unintentional vulnerabilities and malicious software) and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.

- Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.
    
### What is a Be-Secure open source security tech stack
<div align="justify">
There are many open source technologies today providing a variety of options for developers to choose for their project needs. Each technology will have certain vulnerabilities inherent in them. Mostly, This aspect is not factored in during selecting an open source technology for the project hence considerable effort is spent on addressing these inherent vulnerabilities during development or later phase.  To address this problem, we have devised Be-Secure open source security stack.

Be-Secure open source security stack is a classification of technologies for enabling open-source developers to identify & leverage suitable BeSman environments that have been security tested by the Be-Secure open-source community.

The different open-source security tech stacks identified based on their characteristics and type of usage are –

* Security for DevOps Tools

	
* Language and framework security
	
	
* Applications security
	
	
* Distributed application & blockchain security
	
	
* open source security tool 
	
 
All source code for Be-Secure projects are in GitHub under [Be-Secure](https://github.com/Be-Secure)
