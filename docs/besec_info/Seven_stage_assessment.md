This section describes the seven stages of Be-Secure CE security assessment to enhance the security posture of open source projects / open source tech stacks.

Based on the request from the community member / user of Be-Secure project to assess an open source tech stack,

* First stage: The community will first identify the blueprint for BeSman environment using the details on the open source tech stack that has been shared.

* Second stage: If a suitable blueprint doesnâ€™t exist, the community members will work on building a new BeSman environment. This will be the base environment to perform development activities using the shared open source tech stack.

* Third stage: The next stage will be to build the security testing environment/sandbox that can be utilized for conducting security testing for the specific open source tech stack.

* Fourth stage: Conduct security assessment based on the open source tech stack and identify the vulnerabilities in it. This vulnerability information will be published.

* Fifth stage: Identify and develop security patches for the identified vulnerabilities.

* Sixth stage: Upgrade the respective BeSman environments with the confirmed security patches to strengthen their security posture. Publish the upgraded BeSman environments for active consumption

* Seventh stage: For an existing BeSman environment, the community will focus on identifying the latest security vulnerabilities and mapping it to the respective environment. This is a continuous activity that is focused on enhancing the security posture of BeSman environments to address the latest identified vulnerabilities.
