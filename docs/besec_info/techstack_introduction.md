### Open source Security tech stacks:

We have grouped various open source technologies into 5 main categories. By doing so, it will help us to device appropriate security measures and processes to enhance the security of these open source tech stacks.

We should be able to accommodate almost all the existing open source technologies in any one of the 5 categories. The categories are defined based on the common characteristics and usage of the respective open source technologies.

There are two environment for each tools defined under each stack:

    1. bes-<TOOL>dev-env
    2. bes-<TOOL>esec-env

  bes-<TOOL>dev-env

    In this environment user will get all tools to develup 
    that partikular tool or tools using that tool

  bes-<TOOL>sec-env

    Under this environment, user will be armed with many security tools, 
    to perform security testing of the techstack tool.



At present, All tech stack and related applications are under Requirement gathering and analysis phase **(R G&A)**

Once Requirement gathering and analysis phase completed, each tech stack will be updated with another column named security 
  status which indicates the current security vulnarabilities and fix status of that application. 
  
### At a glance

At the moment, there are 5 broad classification made on the Open Source tools/project, each section is called a tech stack.
These includes

  > DevOps Tool Security

  > Language and Framework security

  > Application security

  > Distributed Application or Blockchain Security

  > Open Source Security Tool Security 

DevOps techstack consists of 6 applications with 12 environments.  These applications includes, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Docker, Kubernetes and Openshift.
At present these are in Reasearch and Development stage (R&D)  

Application count is almost 11 with Language and Framework section, which accounts for 22 environments. 

Currently we have idnetified 8 application in application category with 16 environemnts. 

In aggregate, there are 5 tech stacks with 40+ environments are under Reasearch and Development stage.
