<h1> Getting started </h1>

Security for open source projects is of prime importance for us. We have identified different open source security tech stacks – grouping various open source technologies under each of these identified open source security tech stack. Please feel free to check out more about the open source security tech stack by visiting the following section in our website  [BeS tech stacks](./tech_stack.md)

Creation of open source security tech stack is the first stage in our pursuit for open source security. As the next stage we have created the BeSman utility – it is a command-line utility that will enable users to install project environments based on their project needs in a seamless manner without putting much constraint on their available infrastructure. BeSman environments comprise of dev and security testing environments for each identified open source security tech stack. These environments can be customized per project needs and this is the flexibility we would like to share with you. Please refer the following to know more BeSman utility  and various environments that can be provisioned [View various environments](./tech_stack.md)

In case you are not able to identify a suitable BeSman environment for your project, please visit the following [section](./bes-faq.md) to understand how to raise a request for a new environment.

<p > Once you have identified the required BeSman environments, you can access the same from the following GitHub repository. You can use the BeSman environments to set up your development environment or to conduct security testing for your project. The security environments are pre-bundled with open source security tools to help conduct security testing of your projects. You can share your feedback after using the available BeSman environments. This would help us to refine it further. We are happy to help you with the customization on the selected BeSman environments thus enabling you to use these environments with ease. </p>

We also have enabled a Be-Secure Community Dashboard. Please [click here](#) to view the dashboard. The dashboard will enable everyone to view the security posture of identified open source projects we track as part of Be-Secure community initiative. We track these projects to keep a tab on their security posture and help the respective contributors to enhance the security posture of their projects. This list will grow as we move forward. Your projects can be one among the many open source projects we track. In case you would like us to track your project, please do visit the section – [Onboarding](./projects_we_track.md) 


Apart from tracking various open source projects, we as a community also contribute to a no of open source projects. To know more about this, please visit the following [section](./our_oss_project.md).

If you are interested to contribute in the Be-Secure community initiative, there are ample opportunities for you to contribute.
Please have a look at our [contribution](./contribute.md) part.
