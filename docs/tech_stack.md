<h1> Be-Secure Open Source Security tech stacks: </h1>

<p> Open source is a vast technology space. We have frequent releases, bug fixes / patches being published very frequently. It is quite a tedious and time consuming effort for an organization to keep track of all changes that happen across the open source software landscape. Hence we have categorised open source technologies into five Be-Secure Open Source security tech stacks or blue prints to help the Be-Secure community navigate through security assessment of open source projects that are part of one of these categories. </p>

<p> The open source projects are categorized based on purpose, interoperability and technology. They also include other open source dependencies that are frequently required to develop enterprise grade open source solutions. </p>

<img : image of the tech stack to be included here />

<p> Each BeSecure tech stack will be associated with two types of BeSman environments namely the Development or Provisioning environment [Dev] as well as the security testing or security sandbox environment [Sec]. </p>

<h4> bes-<name>dev-env </h4>

<p> This is a development environment configured for an open source project, pre-bundled with all the required tools and dependencies that would help the developer to perform their development activities </p>

<h4> bes-<name>sec-env </h4>

<p> This is a security environment configured for an open source project, pre-bundled with all the required tools and dependencies that would help the security team members to perform their security testing activities. </p>
