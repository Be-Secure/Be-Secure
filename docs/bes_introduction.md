<h2> Benefits from Be-Secure </h2>

<p> Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by Be-Secure security environments to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.

Developers, auditors, and regulators can create new Be-Secure security environments and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.

Security assessment environments aid developers and researchers to identify security issues, like unintentional vulnerabilities and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.

Be-Secure Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.
