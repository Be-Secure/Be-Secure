We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.  
We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:



1. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Be-Secure/Be-Secure/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Be-Secure/Be-Secure/issues); it's that easy!


**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code snapshots if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. 


### Processes expected to follow by each contributors:

- [Process for pull request](./raise_pull_request.md)

- [Process for issues](./raise_issue.md)



### Use a Consistent Coding Style

### Developers View
                                                                                              

Please refer to the following [link](https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman) to know more about BeSman. It is built using bash and can be easily customized to provision new environments for an [open source tech stack](./tech_stack.md) based on open source project requirements. Anyone can leverage BeSman utility to build customized environments for their projects.
&nbsp;

You can set up BeSman utility by following the steps mentioned in the [Readme file.](https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman/blob/master/README.md)
&nbsp;

You can [raise an issue](./raise_issue.md) once you encounter any issue with using available Besman environment scripts or using BeSman utility, we will be glad to help address the issue for you.
&nbsp;

If you are interested in resolving identified issues with the known list of BeSman environments or BeSman utility, you can [raise a pull request](./raise_pull_request.md) with the required fixes. We value your contributions.
