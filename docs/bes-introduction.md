<h1>Be-Secure</h1>

<p>Its an umbrella of open source security projects and utilities tracker maintained by the Be-Secure community with a purpose to enable internet scale open source security by aggregating open source technology stack, and offering a cutting edge open source security tools in an efficient way.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>We envision a future where the Be-Secure community becomes the one-stop for all open source security tools and technologies that interoperate without the need for customized integrations with security handled proactively. </p>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p> Establish a community of open source security specialist through Be-Secure community initiative </p>

<h2> Why Be-Secure ?  </h2>

<p>Today open source software is an integral part of the technology landscape in many organizations. Their adoption rate is increasing year on year. The benefits from open source are multi-fold and it is the way forward to develop capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. </p>

<h2> Be-Secure is for ... </h2>

<p> Organizations, open source developers, security researchers, auditors and regulators â€“ all can benefit from Be-Secure </p>

<h2> TAVOSS: Trusted and Verified Open Source Software </h2>

TAVOSS is a set of principles and practices that can help to accelerate the adoption of open source in enterprises. TAVOSS software is vetted and secure, which can help to address security concerns. The software is also accompanied by documentation and support, which can help to address the lack of knowledge and cultural resistance. </p>

<h2> Benefits of TAVOSS </h2>

- Enhanced maintenance practices and reduced costs.

- Expertise in specific open source projects, driving efficient patching and maintenance.

- Fueling innovation and supporting sustainable development practices.

- Rapid remediation of vulnerabilities and an increased level of security awareness.

<h2> Benefits from Be-Secure </h2>

Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by Be-Secure security environments to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.

Developers, auditors, and regulators can create new Be-Secure security environments and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.

Security assessment environments aid developers and researchers to identify security issues, like unintentional vulnerabilities and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.

Be-Secure Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.
